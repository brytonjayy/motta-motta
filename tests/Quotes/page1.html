        My experience with Jeri has never been anything but perfect. She's funny, goofy and will HYPE YOU UP like you wouldn't believe.

      One of the many things I love about her is she is so down to earth and she makes you feel so comfortable, like you've known her for years (hehe I have) but that's besides the point. You will not regret doing a session with her she is AMAZING.</span>
