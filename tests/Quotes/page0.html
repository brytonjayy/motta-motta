                    Jeri made it so easy to be comfortable. I had never done a boudoir shoot before, but I instantly felt open and vulnerable with Jeri. She is the ultimate hype woman, and greatest supporter. My images were incredibly high quality and I'm not lying when I say that I stare at them every. single. day. Self love is an investment, and it was so worth it.
