                <h4 class="title is-4 motta-subtitle">DO YOU EDIT OUT THINGS I AM INSECURE ABOUT SUCH AS STRETCH MARKS, CELLULITE, ETC?</h4>
                <p class="motta-p">This world is so full of things that aren't real. But you are real and I want to keep your session and your photographs authentic to you. </p>
                <p class="motta-p">Every woman struggles with stretch marks, cellulite, rolls, acne scarring, moles/freckles, scars and other insecurities. Together, let's normalize normal bodies. I only remove temporary things such as bruises, scratches or acne (if requested). When you see your photographs, I want you to see YOU. Not the edited version of you, because you are perfectly you TODAY and that deserves to be celebrated.</p>
