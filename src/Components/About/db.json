She is the ultimate hype woman, and greatest supporter. My images were incredibly high quality and I'm not lying when I say that I stare at them every. single. day. Self love is an investment, and it was so worth it.",

One of the many things I love about her is she is so down to earth and she makes you feel so comfortable, like you've known her for years (hehe I have) but that's besides the point. You will not regret doing a session with her she is AMAZING.",

I can't wait til we shoot again.",

She makes you feel so comfortable and valued before you even walk through the door, and by the time you walk out, you feel like you have a friend and whole new sense of confidence in yourself. I truly could not recommend shooting with her enough.",

I have had 2 boudoir sessions with Jeri and she helped me feel confident & happy. I have always been pleased with the outcome of the photos and blown away that I can look so good! I love Jeri's style so much because her boudoir is classy and tasteful. I highly recommend Jeri to any woman who wants to feel sexy, classy and confident.",

The day of my shoot, Aunt Flo decided to come and I was so worried about how this would effect how I felt about my body and being naked with just sheets. She was SOOO understanding and reassured me it was going to be the best day ever. And it was!! I look at my pictures and all I think about was the greatest day ever, celebrating me! I canâ€™t wait to work with Jeri again!",
